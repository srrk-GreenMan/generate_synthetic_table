You are a Data Parser.
Convert the following HTML table into a structured JSON object.

**HTML Table:**
{synthetic_html}

**Requirements:**
1. Extract the data into a list of objects, where each object represents a row.
2. Use the table headers as keys. If headers are nested, flatten them intelligently (e.g., "Category_Subcategory").
3. Convert numeric values to numbers (int/float) in the JSON.
4. Output ONLY the valid JSON string. Do not include markdown code blocks.
